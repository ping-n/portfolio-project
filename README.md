### **Blog page**

The blog page display each in slider that expand to reveal the blog content for specific date, i wanted to create a fun design that represent as multiple book stack in a bookcase. The individual blog expanding is represent opening a book and finding the adventure that took place. The only problem with such design is that is not mobile friendly as the element is squish together as the screen get smaller. The only way way to fix this problem is to make a different layout style when the user is accessing the website from mobile but it take away from the user experience.

The main concept for this portfolio website was to introduce the the user to who I am such as my skills and interests, and background. 

- The colour palette remain the same throughout the website with the navigation bar and footer remain consistent throughout different html pages
- The background images changes as it represent my hobbies for traveling across Asia. Melbourne is selected for the home page because it is my current location, Cambodia for the about page as it is my birthplace. Thailand and Japan is the background image for blog and project page as those are my two favorite country to visit in Asia.
- Semantic Html was use throughout the coding process to make it easier for recruiter or other developer to read my code and see my logic and help make their decision in regard to hiring me in the future or to collaborate on projects.
